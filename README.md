## Setup & Contributing

**Git Flow:**
* Fork repository & clone
* Create a branch for new work
* Name the branch `username/intended-work-done-in-branch`
* Push branch to the forked repository (to origin)
* Create "Pull Request" against the original repository (upstream)

**To Sink Your Local Branch With Upstream:** 
`git pull https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git BRANCH_NAME`
Which for us is...
`git pull https://github.com/djb-code/html5-canvas-basics.git master`

**Developing:**
* Code files are located in /src (this is where you program)
* Run `gulp default` to compile your code (puts it all in the dist folder)
* Open index.html in a browser to see the result


### TODO

* Implement livereload?
* A source that works without building?
